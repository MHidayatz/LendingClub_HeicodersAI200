## HEICODERS AI200 Capstone Project ##

This respository is dedicated to what I learned from Heicoders
[AI200 Applied Machine Learning](https://heicodersacademy.com/AI200-applied-machine-learning-course).

This In-Class Prediction Challenge is modelled after the LendingClub Issued Loans dataset. LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.

The codes from jupyter notebook are deployed on [Streamlit](https://mhidayatz-lendingclub-heicodersai200-app-2120nh.streamlit.app/).
